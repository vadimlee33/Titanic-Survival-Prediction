# Titanic Survival Prediction
This is one of my first Machine Learning team projects.
In this project using ML we are trying to predict whether a person survived or not.
Machine Learning Classification Algorithms we used during the project:
- LogisticRegression
- KNN
- Gradient Boosting
- Random Forest
- SVC

All algorithms were used from the scikit-learn open source library.

As you can see Gradient Boosting Classifier shows best performance, but there is an overfit as well.
